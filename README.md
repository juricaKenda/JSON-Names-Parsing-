# JSON Parsing and Data Extraction

In this project, I had tackled the challenge of working with somewhat big data set, in JSON format. The goal was to learn how to properly parse such amount of data and efficiently store it for future use (whatever kind it may be). I did my best to get the job done in the most straightforward and optimal way I could think of.

## Getting Started

To follow my footsteps and try this challenge on your own, I urge you to read the next couple of paragraphs until you get some ideas flowing. Before the coding begins, you will need to satisfy a couple of requirements in order to make life a little bit easier for yourself.

### Prerequisites

```
json-simple-1.1.1
```
```
Standard Java Libraries
```


### Installing

Download the json-simple library.

```
In the project repository, I had attached the library I had used to successfully parse JSON file. Simply download the library and add it to your Build Path in your IDE (assuming you are working in one).
```

Download the data set you will be working on.

```
I found a lot of interesting data sets on the page : 
https://catalog.data.gov/dataset?res_format=JSON
You can either choose one from their page or take the one already sitting in this repository. The file is called "names.json" .
```

To have a deeper look into my solution, download the file named "Names.java".

```
In the project repository, I had attached my solution file. Before running the main method inside that file, you will have to make sure the Path to file is correctly configured. You can easily configure it in the class attribute named "inputFile" in the very top of the class.
```
